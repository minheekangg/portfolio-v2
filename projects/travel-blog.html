        <h6>DURATION</h6>
        <p>Personal Project</p>
        <p>1 month</p>
        <h6>GOAL</h6>
        <p>
            As I continue my journey of limiting the things I own + becoming a minimalist, I wanted to find a way to display all my sentimental items (train tickets, museum tickets, photobooth pics etc) and show pictures from my travels.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also wanted to learn more about NodeJS + Express + having storage in the cloud. 
        </p>
        <h6>CHALLENGE</h6>
        <p>
            I had to re-do the relationship schema when I was 3/4 of the way done. I thought about just pushing through and ignoring certain parts of the responses from the backend, but decided to humbly reevaluate the relationships - what better way to learn, right?
